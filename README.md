# PlantsVZombies

This project was started based off of a previous in class project in Java. I was trying to practice converting a plants verses zombies game to C# from Java. 


# Overview of the project
The project right now is capable of spawning random "zombies" on screen and then making them clickable, but the full functionality of the game isn't finished. If you want to see that check out my Java version here. 


# Consulted works:
 - Previous plants Vs. Zombies assignment 
 - Tyler Gordon 

# Acknowledgements:

This was partially modified from Java code of a previous project but I wanted to transfer it into C# which was a language I had little experience with at the time. The full functionality didn't get finished due to school but maybe I will come back to it one day.
